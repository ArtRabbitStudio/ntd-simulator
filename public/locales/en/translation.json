  "modelText": " is a stochastic micro-simulation of individuals with worm burden, microfilaraemia and other demographic parameters relating to age and risk of exposure. Humans are modelled individually, with their own male and female worm burden. The concentration of mf in the peripheral blood is modelled for each individual deterministically and increases according to the number of fertile female worms as well as decreasing at constant rate. The total mf density in the population contributes towards the current density of L3 larvae in the human-biting mosquito population, where the distribution of L3 amongst the human-biting mosquito population is completely homogeneous. An empirically derived relationship is used for the uptake of mf by a mosquito, where both Culex and Anopheles uptake curves are implemented depending on setting. The model dynamics are therefore divided into the individual human dynamics, including age and turnover; worm dynamics inside the host; microfilariae dynamics inside the host and larvae dynamics inside the mosquito.",

  "LF0": "Lymphatic filariasis",
  "LF1": "About Lymphatic filariasis",
  "LF2": "Lymphatic filariasis is due to filarial parasites which are transmitted to humans through mosquitoes. ",
  "LF3": "When a mosquito with infective stage larvae bites a person, the parasites are deposited on the person's skin from where they enter the body. The larvae then migrate to the lymphatic vessels where they develop into adult worms in the human lymphatic system. Infection is usually acquired in childhood, but the painful and profoundly disfiguring visible manifestations of the disease occur later in life. Whereas acute episodes of the disease cause temporary disability, lymphatic filariasis (LF) leads to permanent disability.",
  "LF4": "Disease Burden",
  "LF5": "LF is endemic in 83 countries and there are an estimated 120 million cases, including 25 million men with hydroceles and 15 million people, primarily women, with lymphedema. The disease occurs throughout the tropical areas of Africa, Asia, the Americas and the Pacific, with around 66% of the infection clustered in South-East Asia and most of the remaining infection (~33%) centered in Africa.",
  "LF6": "Transmission Dynamics",
  "LF7": "LF is caused by a species of filarial round worms, or nematodes, with up to 90% of all infections caused by Wuchereria bancrofti. In some parts of Asia, LF is caused by Brugia malayi and Brugia timori.  Various mosquito species transmit these worms: Culex mosquitoes transmit W. bancrofti in urban and semi-urban areas, Anopheles mosquitoes transmit worms in rural environments, especially in Africa, and Aedes mosquitoes are responsible for transmission throughout the Pacific.",
