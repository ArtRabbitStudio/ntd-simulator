  summaryTab1Content: |
    Geographic and historic MDA data is a stochastic micro-simulation of individuals with worm burden, microfilaraemia and other demographic parameters relating to age and risk of exposure. Humans are modelled individually, with their own male and female worm burden. The concentration of mf in the peripheral blood is modelled for each individual deterministically and increases according to the number of fertile female worms as well as decreasing at constant rate. The total mf density in the population contributes towards the current density of L3 larvae in the human-biting mosquito population, where the distribution of L3 amongst the human-biting mosquito population is completely homogeneous. An empirically derived relationship is used for the uptake of mf by a mosquito, where both Culex and Anopheles uptake curves are implemented depending on setting. The model dynamics are therefore divided into the individual human dynamics, including age and turnover; worm dynamics inside the host; microfilariae dynamics inside the host and larvae dynamics inside the mosquito.

    ## About Schistosomiasis

    Schistosomiasis is a disease of poverty that leads to chronic ill-health. Infection is acquired when people come into contact with freshwater infested with the larval forms (cercariae) of parasitic blood flukes, known as schistosomes. The microscopic adult worms live in the veins draining the urinary tract and intestines. Most of the eggs they lay are trapped in the tissues, and the body’s reaction to them can cause massive damage.

    More information on Schistosomiasis [WHO website.](https://www.who.int/health-topics/lymphatic-filariasis#tab=tab_1)


    ### Disease Burden

    Schistosomiasis affects almost 240 million people worldwide, and more than 700 million people live in endemic areas. Several million people all over the world suffer from severe morbidity as a consequence of schistosomiasis. The economic and health effects of schistosomiasis are considerable, and the disease disables more than it kills. In children, schistosomiasis can cause anaemia, stunting and a reduced ability to learn, although the effects are usually reversible with treatment.


    ### Transmission Dynamics

    Microscopic adult worms live in the veins draining the urinary tract and intestines. Most of the eggs they lay are trapped in the tissues, and the body’s reaction to them can cause massive damage. The infection is prevalent in tropical and sub-tropical areas, in poor communities without potable water and adequate sanitation. Urogenital schistosomiasis is caused by Schistosoma haematobium and intestinal schistosomiasis by any of the organisms S. guineensis, S. intercalatum, S. mansoni, S. japonicum, and S. mekongi.


    ### Interventions

    Praziquantel is the recommended treatment against all forms of schistosomiasis. It is effective, safe, and low-cost. Even though re-infection may occur after treatment, the risk of developing a severe disease is diminished and even reversed when treatment is initiated and repeated in childhood.

    Schistosomiasis control has been successfully implemented over the past 40 years in several countries, including Brazil, Cambodia, China, Egypt, Mauritius, Islamic Republic of Iran, Oman, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Tunisia.

    In Burundi, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Niger, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, the United Republic of Tanzania, and Yemen, it has been possible to scale-up schistosomiasis treatment to the national level and have an impact on the disease in a few years. An assessment of the status of transmission is required in several countries. Over the past 10 years, there has been a scale-up of treatment campaigns in several sub-Saharan countries, where most of those at risk live.


    ### Simulation Model
    The underlying model is stochastic and individual-based. The model tracks the number of male and female worms that an individual has with time and the stochastic processes of worm acquisition and loss. The main intervention is mass drug administration (MDA), where we can apply different coverage levels and treatment frequency. You can find a full model description in the accompanying [Advances in Parasitology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0065308X16300720?via%3Dihub) chapter in the further reading section. Please note that the mean expected behaviour of the individual based stochastic model is identical to the [predictions of a deterministic version of the model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436516300809?via%3Dihub).  

    ### Model code

    We are committed to making our model code available for use by other modellers. Below are links to code used in a recent publication (deterministic version of the model):

    - [The code for the Imperial College model is available here.](https://www.ntdmodelling.org/sites/www.ntdmodelling.org/files/content/ICLSchistoCode.zip) This paper is focused on Schistosoma haematobium, but the model code includes a parameter set for Schistosoma mansoni.
