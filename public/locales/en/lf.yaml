    Lymphatic filariasis is due to filarial parasites which are transmitted to humans through mosquitoes.

    When a mosquito with infective stage larvae bites a person, the parasites are deposited on the person's skin from where they enter the body.
    The larvae then migrate to the lymphatic vessels where they develop into adult worms in the human lymphatic system. Infection is usually acquired in childhood, but the painful and profoundly disfiguring visible manifestations of the disease occur later in life.
    Whereas acute episodes of the disease cause temporary disability, lymphatic filariasis (LF) leads to permanent disability.

    ### Disease Burden

    LF is endemic in 83 countries and there are an estimated 120 million cases, including 25 million men with hydroceles and 15 million people,
    primarily women, with lymphedema. The disease occurs throughout the tropical areas of Africa, Asia, the Americas and the Pacific,
    with around 66% of the infection clustered in South-East Asia and most of the remaining infection (~33%) centered in Africa.
