  summaryTab1Content: |
    Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide. It is caused by an obligate intracellular bacterium called Chlamydia trachomatis. The infection is transmitted by direct or indirect transfer of eye and nose discharges of infected people, particularly young children who harbour the infection's principal reservoir. Particular species of flies can spread these discharges.

    ## About Trachoma

    Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide. It is caused by an obligate intracellular bacterium called Chlamydia trachomatis. The infection is transmitted by direct or indirect transfer of eye and nose discharges of infected people, particularly young children who harbour the infection's principal reservoir. Particular species of flies can spread these discharges.

    ### Disease Burden

    Trachoma is hyperendemic in many of the poorest and most rural areas of Africa, Central and South America, Asia, Australia and the Middle East. It is responsible for the blindness or visual impairment of about 1.9 million people. It causes about 1.4% of all blindness worldwide.

    Overall, Africa remains the most affected continent and the one with the most intensive control efforts. The burden of trachoma on affected individuals and communities is enormous. The economic cost in terms of lost productivity from blindness and visual impairment is estimated at US$ 2.9–5.3 billion annually, increasing to US$ 8 billion when trichiasis is included.

    Visual impairment or blindness results in a worsening of the life experience of affected individuals and their families, who are normally already amongst the poorest of the poor. Women are blinded up to 4 times as often as men, probably due to their close contact with infected children and their resulting greater frequency of infection episodes.



    ### Transmission Dynamics

    The infection spreads through personal contact (via hands, clothes or bedding) and by flies that have been in contact with discharge from the eyes or nose of an infected person. With repeated episodes of infection over many years, the eyelashes may be drawn in so that they rub on the surface of the eye, with pain and discomfort and permanent damage to the cornea.

    In areas where trachoma is endemic, active (inflammatory) trachoma is common among preschool-aged children, with prevalence rates that can be as high as 60–90%. The infection becomes less frequent and shorter in duration with increasing age. Infection is usually acquired when living in close proximity to others with active disease, and the family is the main setting for transmission. An individual's immune system can clear a single episode of infection, but in endemic communities, re-acquisition of the organism occurs frequently.



    ### Interventions

    Elimination programmes in endemic countries are being implemented using the WHO-recommended **SAFE** strategy. This consists of:

    - **S**urgery to treat the blinding stage (trachomatous trichiasis);

    - **A**ntibiotics to clear infection, particularly mass drug administration of the antibiotic azithromycin, which is donated by the manufacturer to elimination programmes, through the International Trachoma Initiative;

    - **F**acial cleanliness; and

    - **E**nvironmental improvement, particularly improving access to water and sanitation.

    Most endemic countries have agreed to accelerate the implementation of this strategy to achieve elimination targets. Data reported to WHO by the Member States for 2019 show that 92,622 people with trachomatous trichiasis were provided with corrective surgery in that year, and 95.2 million people in endemic communities were treated with antibiotics to eliminate trachoma.
