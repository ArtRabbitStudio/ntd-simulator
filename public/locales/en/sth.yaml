  summaryTab1Content: |
    Geographic and historic MDA data is a stochastic micro-simulation of individuals with worm burden, microfilaraemia and other demographic parameters relating to age and risk of exposure. Humans are modelled individually, with their own male and female worm burden. The concentration of mf in the peripheral blood is modelled for each individual deterministically and increases according to the number of fertile female worms as well as decreasing at constant rate. The total mf density in the population contributes towards the current density of L3 larvae in the human-biting mosquito population, where the distribution of L3 amongst the human-biting mosquito population is completely homogeneous. An empirically derived relationship is used for the uptake of mf by a mosquito, where both Culex and Anopheles uptake curves are implemented depending on setting. The model dynamics are therefore divided into the individual human dynamics, including age and turnover; worm dynamics inside the host; microfilariae dynamics inside the host and larvae dynamics inside the mosquito.

    ## About Soil-transmitted helminth

    Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections are among the most common infections worldwide and affect the poorest and most deprived communities. They are transmitted by eggs present in human faeces which in turn contaminate soil in areas where sanitation is poor.

    The main species that infect people are the roundworm (Ascaris lumbricoides), the whipworm (Trichuris trichiura) and the hookworms (Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale).

    Intestinal worms produce a wide range of symptoms including intestinal manifestations (diarrhoea, abdominal pain), general malaise and weakness. Hookworms cause chronic intestinal blood loss that result in anaemia.

    More information on Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) on the [WHO website](https://www.who.int/health-topics/soil-transmitted-helminthiases#tab=tab_1).

    ### Disease Burden

    Morbidity is related to the number of worms harboured. People with infections of light intensity (few worms) usually do not suffer from the infection. Heavier infections can cause a range of symptoms, including intestinal manifestations (diarrhoea and abdominal pain), malnutrition, general malaise and weakness, and impaired growth and physical development.

    Infections of very high intensity can cause intestinal obstruction that should be treated surgically.

    S. stercoralis may cause dermatological and gastro-intestinal morbidity and is also known to be associated with chronic malnutrition in children. In the case of reduced host immunity, the parasite can cause hyperinfection/dissemination syndrome that is invariably fatal if not promptly and properly cured and is often fatal despite the treatment.

    ### Transmission Dynamics

    Soil-transmitted helminths are transmitted by eggs that are passed in the faeces of infected people. Adult worms live in the intestine, where they produce thousands of eggs each day. In areas that lack adequate sanitation, these eggs contaminate the soil. This can happen in several ways:

    - eggs that are attached to vegetables are ingested when the vegetables are not carefully cooked, washed or peeled;

    - eggs are ingested from contaminated water sources;

    - eggs are ingested by children who play in the contaminated soil and then put their hands in their mouths without washing them.

    ### Interventions

    The WHO recommended medicines –albendazole (400 mg) and mebendazole (500 mg) – are effective, inexpensive and easy to administer by non-medical personnel (e.g. teachers). They have been through extensive safety testing and have been used in millions of people with few and minor side-effects.

    Both albendazole and mebendazole are donated to national ministries of health through WHO in all endemic countries to treat all children of school age. Ivermectin for the control of S. stercoralis is expected to be available at an affordable price from 2021.

    ### Simulation Model

    The underlying model is stochastic and individual-based. The model simulates the worm burden and egg output of each individual and the reservoir of infectious material in the environment. The model can simulate mass drug administration (MDA) with different coverage levels and treatment frequencies. You can find a full model description in [Truscott et al. 2016](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27756454/) and [Coffeng et al. 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436516300780). 

    ### Model code

    You can find the basic model code in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/caro-veg/STH-basic-model). 

    The model code is the same for all three STH species (roundworm, hookworm, whipworm). Only the input parameters are species-specific.

    ### Data

    The data used to parameterise the model are referenced in [Truscott et al. 2016](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27756454/) and [and Coffeng et al. 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436516300780).
