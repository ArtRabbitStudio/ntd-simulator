  summaryTab1Content: |
    Geographic and historic MDA data is a stochastic micro-simulation of individuals with worm burden, microfilaraemia and other demographic parameters relating to age and risk of exposure. Humans are modelled individually, with their own male and female worm burden. The concentration of mf in the peripheral blood is modelled for each individual deterministically and increases according to the number of fertile female worms as well as decreasing at constant rate. The total mf density in the population contributes towards the current density of L3 larvae in the human-biting mosquito population, where the distribution of L3 amongst the human-biting mosquito population is completely homogeneous. An empirically derived relationship is used for the uptake of mf by a mosquito, where both Culex and Anopheles uptake curves are implemented depending on setting. The model dynamics are therefore divided into the individual human dynamics, including age and turnover; worm dynamics inside the host; microfilariae dynamics inside the host and larvae dynamics inside the mosquito.

    ## About Schistosomiasis

    Schistosomiasis is a disease of poverty that leads to chronic ill-health. Infection is acquired when people come into contact with freshwater infested with the larval forms (cercariae) of parasitic blood flukes, known as schistosomes. The microscopic adult worms live in the veins draining the urinary tract and intestines. Most of the eggs they lay are trapped in the tissues, and the body’s reaction to them can cause massive damage.
    
    More information on Schistosomiasis on the [WHO website.](https://www.who.int/health-topics/schistosomiasis#tab=tab_1)

    ### Disease Burden

    Schistosomiasis affects almost 240 million people worldwide, and more than 700 million people live in endemic areas. Several million people all over the world suffer from severe morbidity as a consequence of schistosomiasis. The economic and health effects of schistosomiasis are considerable, and the disease disables more than it kills. In children, schistosomiasis can cause anaemia, stunting and a reduced ability to learn, although the effects are usually reversible with treatment.

    ### Transmission Dynamics

    Microscopic adult worms live in the veins draining the urinary tract and intestines. Most of the eggs they lay are trapped in the tissues, and the body’s reaction to them can cause massive damage. The infection is prevalent in tropical and sub-tropical areas, in poor communities without potable water and adequate sanitation. Urogenital schistosomiasis is caused by Schistosoma haematobium and intestinal schistosomiasis by any of the organisms S. guineensis, S. intercalatum, S. mansoni, S. japonicum, and S. mekongi.


    ### Interventions

    Numerous countries have implemented LF control programmes, with significant achievements in the Americas, the Pacific and Asia. A few countries in Africa are close to their elimination goals. To learn more about LF elimination, please visit the [Global Atlas of Helminth Infections](http://www.thiswormyworld.org/about-worms/elimination-of-lymphatic-filariasis).


    ### Simulation Model

    The underlying model is stochastic and individual-based. Its description includes an individual's worm burden, mf burden as well as aspects of the transmission cycle in mosquito populations. Various interventions are also modelled on the population. The main intervention is mass drug administration (MDA), where different regimens can be selected. Interventions also include vector control including bed-nets and insecticide treatment. A full model description can be found in the accompanying [P&V paper](https://parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13071-015-1152-3), which can be found in the further reading section. Please note that the model has only been validated against a certain number of settings, details of which can be found in the [paper](https://parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13071-015-1152-3).
