  "howItWorks": "The projections on this website provide guidance on how frequency, length of time and higher coverage in treatment strategies can impact how 2023, 2025 and 2030 goals will be achieved. The projections are model-based.",

  "ourMissionHeadline": "Closing the knowledge gap",
  "ourMission": "Quantitative modelling can help inform the many urgent policy issues concerning the control and elimination of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Up until now, a lack of high-quality modelling has prevented donors and policymakers from accessing existing expertise.",
  "ourMissionStatement": "Our NTD Simulator aims to close this knowledge gap.",
  "whatYouCanDoTitle": "What you can do",
  "whatYouCanDo": "This website is for Programme Managers and Implementation Partners and allows you to investigate the potential impact of delays to MDAs due to COVID19 (or other scenarios). It contains estimates of the current prevalence in endemic implementation units, and estimates of the impact of different interruptions to the programme. This interface will allow you to adapt the mathematical modelling to your local knowledge and provide you with the analyses you need to prioritise where MDA needs to be reinstated.",
