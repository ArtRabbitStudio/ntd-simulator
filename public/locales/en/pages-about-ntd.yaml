    ## About

    Many urgent policy issues concerning the control and elimination of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) can only be answered through high-quality quantitative modelling.

    However, a dearth of modelling in this area prevents donors and policymakers from accessing existing expertise. The NTD Modelling Consortium acts as a point of contact to commission modelling to address the right questions. The Consortium is also a conduit for the exchange of ideas, insights and questions between modellers and their users.

    Various factors motivated the creation of the NTD Modelling Consortium:

    - Mathematical modelling for infectious diseases and public health works best through collaborations with epidemiologists, policymakers and field experts.

    - Multiple modelling groups working on the same question allows us to investigate model structure uncertainty – the importance of particular underlying assumptions of each model type.

    - The need for structures that connect modellers and users. Designing and parameterising models raise questions about underlying biology, data availability and implementation policy structures. Conversations between these different sectors will help identify the need for studies to address key uncertainties.

    - NTD modelling lags behind modelling for other infectious diseases and it needs to be able to access the huge advances in the broader modelling field. With the right funding framework and the right relationship between modellers and users, new insight into NTDs will be possible.

    - A recruitment problem: many modellers work on NTDs for a short amount of time due to lack of funding and limited impact of publications, again as a result of the small modelling community. We need mechanisms to attract and keep infectious disease modellers in this area.

    ### The Secretariat

    The secretariat coordinates interactions between NTD MC members and external stakeholders, as well as promoting dialogue among consortium members themselves. The secretariat manages the consortium research agenda and priorities, which includes coordinating research outcomes and outputs and, the dissemination of the results to a broader audience.

    The NTD Modelling Consortium is led by Professor Déirdre Hollingsworth (Big Data Institute, University of Oxford) and Professor Graham Medley (London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine)

    The NTD MC secretariat is formed by:  
    Beth Bruce (Big Data Institute, University of Oxford)  
    Dr Andreia Vasconcelos (Big Data Institute, University of Oxford)  


    ### Members

    The consortium has been brought together to support the global drive to reduce the burden of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) by providing modelling estimates of the epidemiological impact of control strategies. It is a large international modelling effort with at least two modelling groups working on 7 of the 10 diseases in the London Declaration on NTDs. The current members of the NTD Modelling Consortium are:
